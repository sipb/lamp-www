CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Library Access to Music Project -- two students' effort to create a
24-hour electronic library of music accessible on campus in classrooms
and dormitories -- has received an $8,250 grant of hardware, software,
and support from StreetFire Sound Labs of San Francisco, California.
<P>
StreetFire's contribution, which includes the first 10 manufactured
units of its RBX1600 music server, development software, prototype
hardware, and support, will allow LAMP to manage a library of 4,000
CDs in consumer stereo jukeboxes.
<P>
"Thanks to StreetFire's help, MIT students and faculty will again be
able to access LAMP's library of music 24 hours a day, from all across
campus," said Keith Winstein, a graduate student in Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science. "We are very grateful for their
contribution."
<P>
Winstein and Josh Mandel, a senior in the same major, researched
several ways of making a collection of 4,000 CDs available for LAMP's
users, who will access the CDs by acting as disc jockeys and
broadcasting music over MIT's internal cable-television system. Using
the RBX1600 to manage consumer-quality jukeboxes would cost between
$0.90 and $2.40 per CD, Winstein and Mandel calculated. By contrast,
the cost of enough computer CD-ROM jukeboxes to hold 4,000 CDs was
about $100,000, or $25.00 per CD, the students found.
<P>
StreetFire has also donated development software that enabled Mandel
and Winstein to extend the functionality of the RBX1600 to support
LAMP. The RBX1600 uses a version of the GNU/Linux operating system,
which Winstein and Mandel were able to modify with StreetFire's
help. As part of the grant, the students are contributing their
extensions back to StreetFire in the public domain.
<P>
"All of the RBX1600 software is free software, which makes it easy to
modify, but we were very fortunate to have [StreetFire Founder]
Stephen Street's help as well," Mandel said. "He worked tirelessly to
help us make our software run on the RBX1600."

<B>ABOUT LAMP</B>
<P>
The Library Access to Music Project is working to create a 24-hour
academic music library that provides instant access to its collection
in MIT classrooms and dormitories through MIT's cable television
system. LAMP was started in 2001 by two MIT students, Keith Winstein
and Josh Mandel, who are researching the effects of a more-accessible
music library on education and music-listening behavior at MIT. LAMP
is supported by a $60,000 grant from MIT iCampus, the MIT-Microsoft
Alliance. Winstein and Mandel are advised by Professor of Computer
Science and Engineering Hal Abelson.
<P>
In October 2003, LAMP first opened its electronic music library and
briefly allowed MIT students and faculty to access about 48,000 MP3s,
broadcast on-demand over MIT's cable television system. After MIT
announced the opening on October 27, 2003, the company that had sold
LAMP its MP3 files said that it had not had permission to do
so. Accordingly, LAMP announced on October 31, 2003 that it was
temporarily closing the library until it could be sure that the
recordings in LAMP's collection were prepared under authorization from
the copyright owners. LAMP plans to re-open at MIT later this fall and
will publish the complete plans and software for the system as free
software at <a href="http://lamp.mit.edu">http://lamp.mit.edu</a>.
