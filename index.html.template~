<b>LAMP is Temporarily Suspended</b><p>

MIT's Library Access to Music service lets students listen to music over
MIT's analog cable television system.  LAMP was designed to operate in
full compliance with the law and to respect the rights of all copyright
holders.
<p>
MIT has at all times sought to implement a legal music service for its
students. We relied on Loudeye to provide us with authorized content
and for Loudeye to facilitate and obtain the appropriate licenses.  We
have been working with Loudeye on obtaining content since October 2002
and Loudeye assured us on multiple occasions that the content they
provided to us was prepared fully under authorization from the record
labels and on behalf of the publishers.
<p>
MIT took on the responsibility of having the proper public performing
licenses from ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC. After the LAMP service was launched,
Loudeye informed us that some of their assurances to us may have been
mistaken. We are therefore temporarily suspending the LAMP service while
we pursue clarifying discussions with Loudeye, the record labels,
and music publishers. MIT continues to be committed to developing
a fully licensed service.<p>
